# Somos Molai

The "Somos Molai" story begins now, here in Nicaragua, in the department of Granada. Most of us realize that the climate of the planet is warming and that dramatic and necessary changes are required now, through international agreements and commitments but, there are actions that each of us must take immediately. Our forests in Nicaragua are disappearing at a dramatic rate, and their loss has an immediate affect on our climate, our water, and our lives. Our project, "Somos Molai" has been inspired by the work of one man who began by planting a tree in 1979, and through his continuous efforts has created a forest in a place, once desolate. And so, while the world debates who should do what, when and first, we will act, as Jadav "Molai" Payeng, and begin to rebuild our forest, now.

Our goal is simple. To plant, nurture, monitor and protect as many trees annually, as our collected resources permit. This is important and difficult work and those who labor deserve to be rewarded. This is not a project of volunteers. The work is hard, and hot, and requires responsibility and commitment to succeed. There are too many men and women in our community that are without economic purpose or means of advancement, and laboring in reforestation is growth that Nicaragua and the planet can sustain and welcome. We're hopeful that individuals like you, business leaders and shareholders, and government members and their agencies will agree, and that from our modest start, with a few dedicated people in a small community, that from a single sapling planted, will arise our own Molai forest, a tribute to the inspiration of Jadav "Molai" Payeng of India.

While we source saplings appropriate to our area, consult with forest science experts, and partner with private land owners between Managua and Granada willing to be a part of a multigenerational, lasting commitment to the reforestation and conservancy of our own Molai, we hope you'll reach out to us and invest in our part of the world, that the whole globe might exhale in response and we might breathe our way to a greener future for our children.
